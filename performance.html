      <h1>General Performance</h1>

      <p>
        Performance refers to the efficiency and speed at which computational
        resources and services operate. It's a critical factor because it
        directly impacts the user experience, application responsiveness, and
        overall satisfaction of the clients who deploy solutions on the cloud.
      </p>

      <p>
        The performance evaluation conducted using J Meter indicates that AWS is
        the preferable choice in terms of performance.
