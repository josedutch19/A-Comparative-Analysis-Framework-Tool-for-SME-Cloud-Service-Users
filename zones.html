      <h1>Availability Zones</h1>
      <p>
        What is availability zone? An Availability Zone (AZ) is a term commonly
        associated with cloud computing and, more specifically, Amazon Web
        Services (AWS), although other cloud providers have similar concepts. An
        Availability Zone represents a data center or a collection of data
        centers in a distinct geographic location within a specific region. Each
        AZ is designed to be isolated from failures of other AZs, making them
        independent entities.

        If you want to make a choice of cloud service provider based on
        availability zone, it is advised you go for AWS cloud service provider
        (M. Saraswat & R. C. Tripathi, 2020)
