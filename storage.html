        Storage refers to the solution offerings that allow users to save, archive, and manage data in the cloud. These storage solutions are designed to be highly available, scalable, and secure. They come in various types to cater to different needs, such as object storage for vast amounts of unstructured data, block storage for databases or applications, and file storage for shared file systems. The elasticity of cloud storage enables businesses to scale up or down based on their requirements, ensuring they only pay for what they use. Providers also incorporate redundancy and backup solutions to ensure data integrity and recovery in case of failures.
