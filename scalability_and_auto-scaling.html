      <h1>Scalability and Auto-scaling</h1>
      <p>
        Scalability refers to the capability of a cloud environment to handle
        increased demands efficiently. It ensures that as a user's needs grow,
        the system can expand its resources to meet these requirements, whether
        that's processing power, storage, or bandwidth. This adaptability means
        that users won't experience system slowdowns or crashes due to resource
        constraints, ensuring consistent performance regardless of workload.
        Auto-scalability, on the other hand, is an automated process that
        dynamically adjusts resources based on the demand. Instead of manually
        provisioning or de-provisioning resources, the cloud system
        automatically does so based on pre-defined conditions or triggers, such
        as traffic spikes or specific usage patterns. This feature not only
        guarantees optimal performance and cost-efficiency but also eliminates
        the need for constant manual intervention, allowing businesses to focus
        on their core operations while the cloud platform self-manages its
        resource allocation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Both Microsoft Azure and AWS offer capabilities for scaling and
        auto-scaling. You can choose either platform based on your preference.
