      <h1>On-Demand Pricing</h1>
      <p>
        On-demand pricing refers to a pricing model where customers are charged based on their actual usage of a service, without any long-term commitments or upfront fees. In this model, users can access and utilize cloud resources whenever needed and only pay for what they use. It offers flexibility, as users can scale their resources up or down based on demand, ensuring they aren't overpaying for unused capacity. This pricing model is particularly attractive for businesses with fluctuating workloads or for those who are unsure about their long-term resource requirements, as it minimizes financial risks and avoids locking them into predefined contracts. On-demand pricing allows cloud service providers to cater to a broad range of customers, from startups to large enterprises, by offering a pay-as-you-go approach to cloud computing.
